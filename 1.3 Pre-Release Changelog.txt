-Glockulus and Barretina have recieved a complete sprite overhaul, including their Ammonomicon portraits.


-----------Shrines:
-Completely reworked Holy Chamber Shrine
-Holy Chamber Shrine should now spawn in the Abbey with a 100% chance

-----------Guns:
-Arm Warmer has been completely reworked
-The Mop has been completely re-coded and now can attempt to mop up and use the debuffs of goops from other mods.
-Petrifier has recieved a unique mechanic, along with some modified visuals and stats.

-----------Items:
-Death Warrant has been completely reworked
-Table Tech Devour has been completely reworked
-Gun Warrant has been completely reworked
-Injector Rounds has been completely re-coded and now can attempt to create goops from debuffs of other mods.

-Systems:
-The conditions for the Time Trader to spawn has been completely reworked.
-The Something Wicked event should hopefully be less glitchy, along with the AI rework of Something Wicked.
-With the Hell-Curses being recoded, certain effects have been slightly altered, such as the lifetime of curse-zones from Curse Of Petrification.
-Stopped Hell Curses from giving more than 1 chest drop randomly in a room while a curse/curses is active BUT made chests from room clears more common. 

================Fixes:
-----------Dungeon Generation:
-Fixed multiple combat rooms that were never tagged to appear.

-----------Shrines:
-The Gun Orbit Shrine should now spawn properly again
-Fixed a long standing issue where shrines from this mod could affect the chances of things like Black Markets generating. This should now be mostly migitated, but now the Gun Orbit Shrine and Null Shrine no longer have unique shrine rooms.
-The amount of Purity Shrines that spawn should now be 100% consistent (4)

-----------Enemies:
-Fixed most/all custom enemies from dealing contact damage while spawning
-Fixed audio related issues with Detscavators
-Shellrax should now have its glowing eye always active
-Fixed Grenade Kin/Pinheads not dealing any damage at all
-Hopefully prevented Annihi-Chamber from continuing its bulletscript that it uses in conjunction with the beam attack when changing phases.
-Shambers can no longer absorb any type of beam (this was only really noticeable on slow moving beams but still needed a fix regardless)

-----------Items:
-Sack Of Pickups now spawn properly, and will occasionally appear on shops
-Fixed Never Forgive Me erroring if the player had no items that activated upon harming an enemy and fixed it using the wrong sprites
-Fixed Null Pickups not being able to be used if you didn't have an active item.
-Volatile tesla-Pack should be a bit less jarring with its distortion waves.
-Heresy Breaker can now be used on Purity Shrines even if the player cannot use them
-Energy-Plated Shields recharge time for the individual orbitals has been reduced from 5s -> 3s

-----------Guns:
-Hopefully fixed Riftaker from leaving rifts behind
-Hopefully fixed all beam weapons from being able to still be firing while reloading *while* firing.
-Hardlight Nailguns active reload mechanic should now actually function. This issue was hard to pin-point as just giving it to yourself via the console would make it work fine, but getting it through normal means would not.
-Fixed a potential issue with the BSG where its projectiles would be a lot smaller than intended.
-Fixed Protract-non being affected by damage ups twice-fold (a 1.25x damage multiplier would function as a 1.6x~ damage multiplier for that weapon)

-----------Misc:
-Hopefully reduced the chances of floors failing to load.
-Rebuilt the Hell Curses system from the ground up to be more stable/consistent and less buggy.

================Misc:
-----------Dungeon Generation:
-A large amount of rooms got tweaks, relating to terrain placement, decoration, and some enemy placement.
-Altered the chances of certain rooms showing up, but mainly chest rooms.

-----------Shrines:
-The Hell Curse shrines positions will be randomized each time you go to Bullet Hell.
-Purity Shrines will now be much less intrusive during combat.

-----------Enemies:
-Cursebulons now can fall into pits and die/ made their moving sprites bouncier.
-Cursebulon Goop now has a slightly shorter lifetime (13s -> 11.5s)
-Hopefully fixed flight pathing for flying enemies.
-Made the Shamber fly.
-Ophanaim And Annihi-Chamber are now able to fly.
-Shellrax's desparation attack now scales with its current HP instead of a timer. This makes the attack amp up faster if the player is actively injuring him. (Max bullet fire speed is capped, done worry.)
-Glockulus and Barretina have recieved a sprite overhaul to match with the Ophanaim.

-Any instances of Deturrets have been replaced with a variant that:
--Will take no damage
--Cannot be moved by Gungeons "move enemies away from entrance" system
--Cannot have debuffs applied
--Will not get modified by certain enemy post-processing effects
--Should not be targeted by homing effects anymore.

-Altered the weight of enemies so they can get knocked back.
Of note:
  Arch Gunjurers have had their weight reduced from 800 -> 200
  Cursebulons have had their weight reduced from 150 -> 25
  Fodder have had their weight increased from 800 -> 100000
  Glockulus have had their weight reduced from 100 -> 50
  Skullvenants have had their weight reduced from 800 -> 50

-Altered a single line from Shellrax's dialogue to make more sense
-Altered some of Annihi-Chambers attacks to be more fair and less telefraggy
-Annihi-Chamber has a reworked beam attack with telegraphs.
-Both of Annihi-Chambers dash attacks now have visual telegraphs (for if they're off screen.)
-Annihi-Chambers movement speed has been greatly reduced, but buffed his base HP from 450 -> 500.
-Bullet Banker should now have a cap on active minions, meaning it'll stop using minion-spawning attacks once this cap is reached
-Bullet Banker recieves two new minions.
-Altered some other Bullet Banker minions slightly.
-Shellrax now triples his max HP upon entering his desparation phase. This should make damaging him not increase his fire rate of his desparation attack as much, but while still letting it ramp up consistently as his HP drains at a consistent rate.

-Arch Gunjurers base HP has been reduced from 60 -> 55, and should also have a much more consistent hitbox that correlates to their sprite.
-Barretinas recieved a tweaked hitbox.

-Ophanaim recieved some attack reworks, reduced movement speed and has had their base HP reduced from 1450 -> 1200

-Most enemies will now have proper, more fitting shadows.
-Fodder should no longer be affected by the games "move away from entrance" mechanic to prevent them being in places they shouldn't

-Debuffs:
-All debuff icon placement are now handled properly by the game instead of by the debuff itself. (Weird to explain but now debuff icons should be removed cleanly and positioned hopefully correctly)
-Frailty should no longer attempt to reduce an enemies HP past the enemies miniumum HP threshold, which could cause softlocks with certain enemies.
-Frailtys duration has been extended (5s -> 8s)

-----------Items:
-Table Tech Null now converts a random pickup in the room into a null pickup.
-Blast Shower now gives temporary fire/poison immunity, should now better spread its debuffs to enemies and has had its cooldown reduced from 300 dmg -> 250 dmg
-Blast Shower should now better spread its debuffs to enemies.
-Shelltans Blessing proc chance has been doubled, has a VFX when it procs, and has a new effect related to the Shelltan Shrine (Shrine now grants a 1.15x damage multiplier, a 0.9x ammo capacity multiplier and refills all your guns, without giving any curse while Shelltans Blessing is held)
-Table Tech Devour recieves a new synergy, that fits with its new reworked state
-Tome Of Guonmancy has been buffed: Reduced cooldown from 300 dmg -> 250 dmg / orbital lifetime increased from 10s -> 15s
-Shell-heart now gives 1 armor on pickup.
-Prayer Amulet is now unlocked by killing 5 Umbral enemies
-Volatile Tesla-Pack now does *slightly* more damage
-All of Scroll Of Guonifications synergies now buff their respective orbitals HP by 33% instead of 20%.
-Some of Tome Of Guonmancys synergy effects now activate more often 
	(Chapter Of Class proc chance increased from 8% to 10%)
	(Chapter Of Restoration proc chance increased from 5% to 7%)
-Heresy Breaker now activates the special effects for breaking certain shrines a bit more commonly
-Blood Idols reward effect has been visually revamped, and the item will no longer be consumed when used, but will still deduct 250 kills from its count. To counter this, it is now more likely to pay out with lower tiers of item/gun.
-Never Forgive Me has recieved a new item sprite
-Portable Pylon damage per tick has been increased from 6 -> 12.

-Wither Lance recieved some improved coloring, new projectile sprites and some stat and visual changes.
